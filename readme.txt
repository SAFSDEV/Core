This repository contains Core codes like services, drivers, engines and hooks etc.

On top of the framework code, we also provide special drivers like SAFS, JSAFS, 
and SeleniumPlus for handling traditional keywords test records and Java API calls. 

The project contains keyword implementation "engines" for different testing tools 
like "IBM Rational Functional Tester", "Selenium 1.0", "Selenium 2.0 WebDriver", 
"iOS UIAutomation", "Android Robotium" etc..

There is code for Image-Based Testing, some rudimentary "Optical Character 
Recognition (OCR)", Cucumber integration, and Java AWT Robot enhancements.

The SAFS installation code is also included in this repository.

This repository can be imported in Eclipse as a normal Java Project. 
It does have a dependency on another repository: SAFS-Android-Remote-Control 

To set up the development correctly, please refer to document developer_setup.txt.
