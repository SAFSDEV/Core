# Environment Setup for Developers

### Step 1: Prepare Build Environment
Before you can successfully run any build, you need to install/verify the following:

1. Prepare Ant
  1. Ant can be downloaded from [Ant Official Website](http://ant.apache.org/). The latest version is recommended and the minimum version required is **1.8.2**.
  2. After installation, we need to set System Environment **ANT_HOME** pointing to the folder, where ant has been installed. For example *c:/apache-ant-1.9.3*.
  3. We also need to add **%ANT_HOME%/bin** to the *PATH* environment variable so that *ant* will be recognized as executable.
  4. Put the following *JARs* into **%ANT_HOME%/lib** folder:
    1. **antcontrib.jar** can be downloaded from [ant-contrib site](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ant-contrib/files/ant-contrib/). The minimum version required is **1.0b3**.
	2. **apache-commons-net.jar** can be downloaded from [commons-net site](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-net/). The minimum version required is **3.3**.
	3. **jakarta-oro-2.0.8.jar** can be downloaded from [Apache archive site](https://archive.apache.org/dist/jakarta/oro/).
2. Install the git bash 
  1. **Git Bash** can be downloaded from [git-scm site](https://git-scm.com/downloads). The latest version is recommended. We are using the version **2.5.0** when writing this document.
  2. We need to add its *bin* directory to the *PATH* environment so that git will be recognized as executable.


### Step 2: Prepare Develop Environment
Before you can successfully run any build, you need to install/verify the following:

1. Clone all repositories into your local folder, for example: to *c:\SAFSDev*. You will have all repositories under that folder:
   - build
   - Core
   - keywords
   - libs
   - META-INF
   - SAFS-Android-Engine
   - ......
   - VBDDVariables
2. Create a "SAFS Build folder", such as *c:\SAFSBuild*, which is used to build SAFS/SE+. Create an Environment Variable **%SAFS_BUILD%** pointing to "SAFS Build folder".
3. Go to *c:\SAFSDev\build\safs*, copy the file *bootstrap.build.xml* to **%SAFS_BUILD%**.
4. Call ```ant -f bootstrap.build.xml bootstrapbuild``` to get all latest ant build scripts.
5. Provide private FTP server:
  1. In *%SAFS_BUILD%/safs.properties* file, you can provide your own private FTP server, which contains the NOT free testing engines, like: Rational Functional Tester, by setting properties: "private.ftpserver", "private.ftpuserid", and "private.ftppasswd". If you don't have private testing engines, the Ant scripts will just ignore these things.
6. Call ```ant safs.win.prepare``` to prepare the development environment. When this succeed, you will be able to see the **libs** and **safsjars**, which contain the dependency files
   needed by SAFS projects.


### Step 3: Import SAFS Projects
1. Open Eclipse, create a new Variable **SAFS_BUILD**, the value is the **SAFS Build folder** (e.g. c:\SAFSBuild) which is created in **Step 1**.
2. Import the project **SAFS-Android-Remote-Control** into Eclipse and build it, it should succeed.
3. Import the core project **Core**
  1. If you don't have the folder **%SAFS_BUILD%/libs/rft** or you don't plan to develop for **SAFS_RFT**:
    1. Delete the whole folder *org\safs\rational*.
    2. Delete all items beginning with *SAFS_BUILD/libs/rft* in **Java Build Path->Libraries**.
  2. Finally you can build this project, it should succeed.


### Note
If the Internet connection is slow, the script running may stuck in DOS console, user can press the *Enter* to let it continue. Please do **NOT terminate** the script manually or close the DOS console, which will leave some hidden folders like "Core", and they will cause the failures for next build.
