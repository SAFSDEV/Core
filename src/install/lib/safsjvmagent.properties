# safsjvmagent.properties (Abbot Sample)
#
# The SAFS Bootstrap AgentClassLoader uses this properties file to know which 
# classes it is supposed to launch and what classpath it should use to locate 
# them.  As an Extensions ClassLoader we do NOT currently have access to the 
# System CLASSPATH setting.  That is why we provide something similar here.
