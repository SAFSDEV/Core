Or, How to Read the SAFS Keyword Reference!</H3>
<SMALL>updated: 2014.03.25</SMALL>
</CENTER></FONT>
<p>
Generally, keywords are listed in <FONT color=BLUE>BLUE</FONT>.<br>
However, keywords that have been deprecated in favor of newer or better keywords should be listed in <FONT color=RED>RED</FONT>.<br>
The reference does not seem to accurately reflect this for all cases just yet. &nbsp;This is not a high priority because 'deprecated' keywords will work indefinitely.&nbsp; However, maintenance or updates to the keyword implementation may not occur if a replacement keyword does exist.
<p>
The SAFS Keyword Reference shows which <SPAN CLASS='Support'>engines</SPAN> support which keywords through small colored icons.
&nbsp;The text inside the icon is a key to the supporting engine. &nbsp;These are listed below:
<p>
<CENTER><TABLE cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2" border="1">

<p>
Engine-specific Keyword References show keywords support for individual <SPAN CLASS='domainMarker'>domains</SPAN>
in that engine through small colored icons. &nbsp;The text inside the icon is a key to the supporting domain.&nbsp;
Each engine may support multiple domains for a given keyword. &nbsp;The domain icons are always adjacent to the engine icon.<br>
<SPAN CLASS="noteLight">Note: Domain means a programming technology (programming language). Domain icon has been added recently,
so it has <b>NOT</b> been used for previously supported engines like <SPAN CLASS='Support' TITLE="Abbot">ABT</SPAN>,
<SPAN CLASS='Support' TITLE="IBM Rational Robot">RC</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS='Support' TITLE="IBM Rational RobotJ">RJ</SPAN> etc.
</SPAN>
<p>
Some known domains are listed below:
<p>
<CENTER><TABLE cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2" border="1">
<TR><TD><SPAN CLASS='domainMarker' TITLE="Development domain">DEV</SPAN><TD>Development domain
<TR><TD><SPAN CLASS='domainMarker' TITLE="DOJO HTML domain">DOJ</SPAN><TD>DOJO HTML domain
<TR><TD><SPAN CLASS='domainMarker' TITLE="Android domain">DRD</SPAN><TD>Native Android domain
<TR><TD><SPAN CLASS='domainMarker' TITLE="Flex domain">FLX</SPAN><TD>Flex domain
<TR><TD><SPAN CLASS='domainMarker' TITLE="HTML domain">HTM</SPAN><TD>Generic HTML domain
<TR><TD><SPAN CLASS='domainMarker' TITLE="IOS domain">IOS</SPAN><TD>Native IOS domain
<TR><TD><SPAN CLASS='domainMarker' TITLE="Java domain">JAV</SPAN><TD>Java domain
<TR><TD><SPAN CLASS='domainMarker' TITLE=".Net domain">NET</SPAN><TD>.Net domain
<TR><TD><SPAN CLASS='domainMarker' TITLE="SAP HTML domain">SAP</SPAN><TD>SAP OpenUI5 HTML domain
<TR><TD><SPAN CLASS='domainMarker' TITLE="VSTO domain">VSTO</SPAN><TD>VSTO domain
<TR><TD><SPAN CLASS='domainMarker' TITLE="WIN domain">WIN</SPAN><TD>Native Windows domain
<TR><TD><SPAN CLASS='domainMarker' TITLE="WPF domain">WPF</SPAN><TD>Windows Presentation Foundation domain
</TABLE></CENTER>
Domain icon example:
<p>
<ul>
<b><a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/TestCompleteCheckBoxFunctionsReference.htm#detail_Check" TITLE="TestComplete CheckBox Check Keyword Reference" target="_blank">TestComplete CheckBoxFunctions::Check</a></b><br><SPAN CLASS='Support'  TITLE='AutomatedQA Test Complete'>TC</SPAN><SPAN CLASS='domainMarker'  TITLE='NET Domain'>NET</SPAN><SPAN CLASS='domainMarker'  TITLE='FLEX Domain'>FLX</SPAN>
<p>
means keyword 'Check' is supported by 'Test Complete Engine' for both '.Net' and 'Flex' domains.
</ul>
As a reminder, this domain support is NOT shown in the main SAFS Keyword Reference for ALL engines.<br>
It is only shown in the separate keyword reference built for each specific engine--as shown in the Test Complete Check command example shown above.
<p>
&nbsp;<br>
SAFS also defines multiple record types as shown in <A href="SAFSRecordFormats.html" target="_blank">SAFS Record Formats</A> standard.
<p><ul>
<li>Driver Commands (C)
<li> Component Function Test Commands (T)
<p>
can be made to support different modes like:
<p>
<li>"Warning Expected" (W)
<li>"Failure Expected" (F) modes.
</ul>
Thus: <B>CW, CF, TW, and TF</B> are valid record types for keywords that support those modes.
<p>
We have color coded the engine icons to indicate the support provided by each engine for every keyword.  The color legend for the engine icons is shown below:
