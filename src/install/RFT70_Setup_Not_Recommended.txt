Notes for RFT 7.0--which has significant bugs and is not well supported.
We highly recommend the user minimally upgrade to RFT V8.0.0.2.


I believe I have confirmed some steps I have taken to make this work from 
the IDE.   There may be other options, but this is what I did to duplicate 
certain errors and then fix them.

I determined that I had the same errors when nothing was part of the
datastore except the TestScript.

To make this work I did the following:

1) Right-click the connected Datastore folder and select "Properties".
2) Expand "Java Compiler" then select "Building".
3) Ensure "Enable Project-specific settings" is ENABLED\CHECKED.
4) In "Output Folder" ensure the following two items are NOT CHECKED:
   a) "Scrub output folders when cleaning projects"
   b) "Rebuild class files modified by others"
5) Click APPLY and\or OK to close the dialog.
   DO NOT REBUILD THE PROJECT IF PROMPTED.

* The following Step #6 may be able to be replaced by copying the JAR *
* files into the RFT customization directory instead of extracting    *
* the .class files into the project datastore.  This has not yet been *
* (re)confirmed.                                                      *
*                                                                     *

6) Extract the following JAR files into the RFT project root directory.
   Ensure you extract "All Files" and ensure you "Use folder names" 
   when extracting the following three zip files:
   a) SAFS.JAR
   b) SAFSRATIONAL_FT.JAR
   c) SAFSRATIONAL_FT_ENABLER.JAR
7) Again, right-click the datastore and select the project "Properties".
8) Edit the "Java Build Path" to include two JAR file libraries:
   a) STAF_LIB - c:\staf\bin\JSTAF.JAR
   b) SAFS_RESOURCES - c:\safs\lib\SAFSDEBUG.JAR
9) Java Build Path references to other SAFS libraries SHOULD NOT be
   necessary.

Remember, you cannot successfully run TestScript from the RFT IDE unless
STAF is running.

You should now be able to run TestScript from within the RFT IDE with STAF
already running.  Building is NOT necessary before running from the IDE.  

Remember, if CLEAN was not properly disabled, then all the CLASS files
extracted will be deleted and they will need to be extracted again.

I do not yet have a means to consistently run RFT 7 from the command-line.
 So RRAFS or TID tests cannot AUTOLAUNCH this engine yet.  With STAF
running, the RFT engine must be manually launched from the RFT IDE before
RRAFS tests or TID tests are launched.
