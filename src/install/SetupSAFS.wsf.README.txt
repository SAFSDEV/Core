SetupSAFS.WSF is the SAFS installer for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems.
However, do not execute this script directly on 64-bit systems.
Instead, on 64-bit systems execute SetupSAFS_WIN64.bat.  
This will properly invoke the 32-bit version of Windows Scripting Host.

SetupSAFS.wsf will then install the following:

   1) SAFS, 
   2) STAF (2.6.11 or 3.3.3), and 
   3) Support for SAFS-driven engines like: 
     
      a) IBM Rational Functional Tester
      b) AutomatedQA Test Complete
      c) Image-Based Testing OCR
   
The three parts are required for SAFS working with Rational tools (RFT) based on STAF properly.

Before starting install SAFS, it is better to ensure that your machine already has the IBM Rational 
tool (For example: RFT), which you want SAFS to work with.
 
User may simply run it with command line "SetupSAFS.wsf" to install SAFS in C:\SAFS and STAF V3.3.3 in C:\STAF as default, 
during which the installer shall interact with user and finally get the installation completed. If you wish to install them 
in different directories with more choices, following command options will help to do it.

     -safs <alternate path> 
     
           Allows the user to specify an alternate install destination.
           Ex: -safs "d:\AltSAFSDir"
     
     -staf <alternate path>
           
           Allows the user to specify an alternate install destination.
           Ex: -staf "d:\AltSTAFDir"
     
     -nostaf
     
           Do not install STAF at this time.
           NOTE: SAFS STAF services and the RobotJ engine will not function 
           without STAF.
     
     -nosafs
     
           Do not install SAFS at this time.
           NOTE: SAFS STAF services and the RobotJ engine will not function 
           without the SAFS install.
     
     -norational
     
           Do not process support for IBM Rational tools at this time.
           NOTE: the RobotJ engine will not function without this install.
     
     -notcafs
     
           Do not process support for Automated QA Test Complete at this time.
           NOTE: the TCAFS engine may not function without this install.
     
     -noocr
     
           Do not process support for Image-Based Testing OCR. [C:\SAFS\ocr]
     
     -noprompt
     
           Proceed with installation without prompting for approval.

     -installstafversion installstafversion

           If -nostaf is not present, this indicate the version of STAF to
			 be installed.
           Ex: -installstafversion 3

     -removestaf installedstafdir stafMajorVersionTobeRemoved

           If you want to uninstall a previously installed STAF, you can use
           this option.
           installedstafdir indicate the installed directory like C:\STAF\
           stafMajorVersionTobeRemoved indicate the major version of STAF, like 2 or 3
           Ex: -removestaf "C:\STAF" 2
           

Examples command-line invocations:

If you prefer STAF 3, modify 2/3 to 3; If STAF 2, modify 2/3 to 2.

1. "SetupSAFS.WSF -installstafversion 2/3 -noprompt"
   -- to install SAFS with RATIONAL and STAF 2 or 3							   	  

2. "SetupSAFS.WSF -installstafversion 2/3 -noprompt -norational"
   -- to install SAFS with STAF 2 or 3

3. "SetupSAFS.WSF -nostaf -noprompt -norational"
   -- to install only SAFS									      									   

4. "SetupSAFS.WSF -installstafversion 2/3 -noprompt -nosafs -norational"
	  -- to install only STAF 2 or 3

5. "SetupSAFS.WSF -removestaf c:\staf 2/3 -noprompt -nostaf -nosafs -norational"
   -- to uninstall only STAF 2 or 3     

6. "SetupSAFS.WSF -safs d:\mysafs"   -- to install SAFS in d:\mysafs with STAF V3.3.3 (in C:\STAF as default).
