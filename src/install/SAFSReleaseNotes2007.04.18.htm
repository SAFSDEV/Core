<h3>CRITICAL REMINDERS</h3>
<p>
This release of SAFS has been a long-time in the making.  The primary focus of this release was to provide NLS testing support within RRAFS and SAFS. A major push to support Selenium as a web testing engine in SAFS was also performed.  If you contributed any code to the SAFSDEV project for inclusion in a future release please review the new source before assuming your contributed code is included in this release.
<p><i>
Because of the extensive NLS effort some generous contributions by third parties are not in this release.  These contributions are slated for another release later this year (2007).  It is not that we do not appreciate and value these contributions, we simply did not have the time and resources to merge, document, and test them while devoted to the NLS and Selenium efforts.</i>
<p>
Affected customizations from previous releases:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Custom modifications in your SAFS install directories &lt; C:\SAFS\bin > batch files
(*.bat or *.vbs), or any SAFSTID.INI in the root SAFS install directory &lt; C:\SAFS >.
</ul>
<p>
If you have taken advantage of any of the customization capabilities of this framework,
then you must take some simple precautions prior to installing this new release.
Installing a new version of the framework will install new, default versions of
customizable files.
<p>
<b>SAFSTID.INI</b><br/>
If you have a modified SAFSTID.INI in your install directory, you should make a back-up,
then evaluate how and if you want to merge with the new file.
<p>
<b>SAFS Batch Files</b><br/>
If you have previously installed the SAFS Framework then you may have manually
modified batch files or VBS scripts to handle custom project paths.  You will need to
backup modified files and evaluate how and if you want to merge such changes with the new
files.
<p>
Failure to perform any of these prescribed backups may erase your prior customizations.
Hopefully, you have backed them up somewhere already as part of your normal ongoing activities.
Right?!
<p>
<b>The highest STAF release that can work with SAFS is STAF 2.6.11 !</b><br/>
SAFS will not work with STAF 3.x or higher!

<p>
STAFWrap.DLL, ComponentFunctions.DLL, DDVariableStore.DLL and associated scripts for registering DVariableStore.DLL
are included in the SAFS\bin directory.  The SetupSAFS script does register and\or move
files to system directories as necessary.
<p>
COM classes supporting COM access to STAF for use in VBScript and other COM-related
features exist in the latest version of DDVariableStore.DLL.  Consult the sourcecode in CVS
or any VBA or COM object browser until more proper documentation is made available.  A very
rudimentary "RUTHere" test script for this COM STAF interface can be found in
SAFS\bin\DDVariableStoreTest.VBS .

<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>

<dl><dt>
<b>Review Backup Reminders in <a href="#reminders">Critical Reminders</a></b>
<p><dd>
If you have not done so, review the <a href="#reminders">Critical Reminders</a> concerning
backups of locally modified or customized files from previous releases.  I'd hate to say,
"I told ya so."
<p></dd><dt>
<b>Short-N-Sweet install instructions:</b>
<p>
A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Windows Scripting Host V5.6 or later is required.  Refer
to <a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/SetupSAFS.README.htm" >SetupSAFS.README</a>
in the Java Runtime and Windows Scripting Host sections for more details and install
information for those tools.
<p><dd>
<ol>
<li><b>Extract the SAFSFramework .ZIP into ANY directory.</b><br/>
Extract all files of the ZIP file into ANY directory.&nbsp; A good choice might be something
like C:\TEMP, or even C:\SAFS.&nbsp; RRAFS (Rational Robot) users might do best to extract into
their ".\Rational\Rational Test\sqabas32" directory. (Although this should not be
necessary with a RRAFS release since that includes the SAFS install files already. Only do
this if you are upgrading SAFS without upgrading RRAFS.)
<p>
Enable "OVERWRITE Existing Files" if you have a previous release.
<p>
<li><b>Run the extracted <b>SetupSAFS.wsf</b> script.</b><br/>
In Windows Explorer, locate "SetupSAFS.wsf" in that directory and double-click to execute
it.<br/>
(Note: previous releases used SetupSAFS.vbs.&nbsp; This file has now been overwritten to call
SetupSAFS.wsf instead.)
<p>
<b>SetupSAFS.wsf</b> will prompt to confirm for the installation of the SAFS Framework and
STAF.&nbsp; The user has the option to skip these installations by pressing "No" or
"Cancel" when prompted.  You do not need to re-install STAF if you already have STAF installed.
<p>
<li><b>Setup SAFS and (optionally) IBM Rational XDE Tester or Functional Tester per
<a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/SetupSAFS.README.htm">SetupSAFS.README</a></b><br/>
Verify/Complete any setup per that doc.
</ol>
</dl>
<p>
<b>SetupSAFS.wsf</b> will not install any program that will appear in Control Panel's
"Add/Remove Program" application.

Additional notes and instructions for this release can be found via the links below.
These are generally reviewed in the listed order.  The files are contained in the
downloaded installation ZIP file and available once all contents of the ZIP file are
extracted into the install directory.

<p>
Most notable items, but not all-inclusive are:
<ul>
<p>
<li><b>Debut release of <a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/doc/org/safs/tools/engines/SAFSSELENIUM.html"
   target=_blank alt="SAFS Selenium Doc" >SAFS/Selenium</a> engine:</b>
<p>
<ul>
Selenium support is fairly extensive, but there are some known issues with using SAFS/Selenium for testing of web clients.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pages with Frames are not currently supported.</b><br/>
Frames may even crash the SAFS/Selenium engine causing testing to cease.
<p>
<li><b>Child browser windows or popup windows are not currently supported.</b><br/>
Child browser windows or popup windows may confuse SAFS/Selenium.
<p>
<li>Selenium intercepts browser Alerts and MessageBoxes and these are not yet testable with SAFS/Selenium at this time.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<li>Improved messaging in many Driver Commands for Functional Tester, TID, and SDC.
