<h3>CRITICAL REMINDERS</h3>
<p>
This release, along with all future releases, provides a simplified install process that supports STAF 3.X installing with Java 1.6. &nbsp;All the latest functionality of SAFS, JSAFS, and supported tools like IBM Rational Functional Tester, AutomatedQA TestComplete, and Image-Based Testing are included in this release. &nbsp;This release also supports installing SAFS on 64-Bit Windows Operating Systems.
<p>
<ul>
<b>*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***</b><br/>
While the latest SAFS and RFT support both STAF V2 and V3, <br>
<i><b>other associated tools like RRAFS using IBM Rational Robot may </i>NOT<i> support STAF V3.</b></i>
<p>
If you are using RRAFS you must continue to use\install STAF V2 unless you have applied RRAFSPatch2010.01.14. &nbsp;That patch provides STAF V3 support to RRAFS.
<p>
<i><b>If installing STAF V2 you </i>MUST<i> have Java 1.5 as the default JVM--</i>NOT<i> Java 1.6 or later.</b></i>
<p>
The AutomatedQA TestComplete tool has not been evaluated for its support of STAF V3 and likely needs to continue using STAF V2.  However, the DDVariableStore.DLL used by TestComplete has been refactored to support both STAF V2 and V3.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Affected customizations from previous releases:<br/></b>
<ul>
<li>Custom modifications in your SAFS install directories &lt; C:\SAFS\bin >
<li>Batch files (*.bat or *.vbs), or any SAFSTID.INI in the root SAFS install directory &lt; C:\SAFS >
<li>Project config files (*.bat or *.ini) in the SAFS Project directory &lt; C:\SAFS\Project >
<li>Project test tables (*.cdd, *.std, *.sdd) files in the SAFS Project Datapool directory &lt;C:\SAFS\Project\Datapool >
<li>Object mapping files (*.dat) in your SAFS lib directory &lt; C:\SAFS\lib >
</ul>
<p>
If you have taken advantage of any of the customization capabilities of this framework,
then you must take some simple precautions prior to installing this new release.
Installing a new version of the framework will install new, default versions of
customizable files.
<p>
<b>SAFSTID.INI</b><br/>
If you have a modified SAFSTID.INI in your install directory, you should make a back-up,
then evaluate how and if you want to merge with the new file.
<p>
<b>SAFS Batch Files</b><br/>
If you have previously installed the SAFS Framework then you may have manually
modified batch files or VBS scripts to handle custom project paths.  You will need to
backup modified files and evaluate how and if you want to merge such changes with the new
files.
<p>
In addition, some of the Batch files have been modified to show support for 64-bit Windows systems
where Java is being invoked.&nbsp; These batch files must be properly edited to launch a 32-bit JVM.
<p>
<b>SAFS Project Files</b><br/>
If you have previously installed and edited any of the INI or BAT files in the SAFS\Project directory then you will need to backup these modified files and evaluate how and if you want to merge such changes with the new files.
<p>
<b>SAFS Object Mapping Files</b><br/>
If you have previously installed and edited any of the following files then you will need to backup the modified files and evaluate how and if you want to merge your edits with the new (default) versions of these files:
<ul>
<li>JavaObjectsMap.dat
<li>ObjectTypesMap.dat
<li>CustomJavaObjectsMap.dat
<li>CustomObjectTypesMap.dat
</ul>
<p>
Failure to perform any of these prescribed backups may erase your prior customizations.
Hopefully, you have backed them up somewhere already as part of your normal ongoing activities...
Right?!
<p>
<H3>STAF 2.6.11 and STAF 3.3.X and JAVA 1.6</H3>
SAFS can be installed to work with either STAF 2.6.11, or STAF 3.3.3 and above.  However, note the following installation limitations below:
<p>
<ul>
<li>It is highly recommended to install and use STAF 3.3.X for new installations using RFT or IBT.<br>
Support for STAF 2.X is only provided for scenarios requiring interaction with remote machines having STAF 2.X installed and for users still using IBM Rational Robot (RRAFS) without RRAFSPatch2010.01.14.
<p>
<li><b>STAF 2.6.11  *REQUIRES*  Java 1.5 to install.</b> &nbsp;STAF 2.6.11 will <b>NOT</b> successfully install using Java 1.6 or later.<br>
However, STAF 2.6.11 can use Java 1.6 AFTER it has been successfully installed.<br>
Most machines do NOT have earlier versions of Java installed. &nbsp;If you intend to install STAF 2.6.11 and do not have Java 1.5 on your machine then you will have to download and install Java 1.5 from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/5u20/jre" alt="Sun Java 1.5 Archives" target="_blank">Sun Java 1.5 Archives</a>.
<p>
<b>It is important to note that 64-bit systems might have a 64-bit Java JVM installed.</b>
&nbsp; Testing has shown that we can install 32-bit SAFS and STAF using the 64-bit JVM,
&nbsp; but <b>SAFS and STAF will require a 32-bit Java JVM to use at runtime.</b>
&nbsp; SAFS Batch scripts in the SAFS install directories, including those in the SAFS\Project space
may need to be edited to point to the desired 32-bit JRE installed on the 64-bit system.
<p>
<li>STAF 3.3.X can successfully install and run with Java 1.6 as well as earlier and later versions of Java.<br>
It is highly recommended to install and use STAF 3.3.X for new installations not using IBM Rational Robot.<br>
Support for STAF 2.X is only provided for scenarios requiring interaction with remote machines having STAF 2.X installed and for users still using IBM Rational Robot (RRAFS) without RRAFSPatch2010.01.14.

<p>
<b>Note: STAFWrap.DLL and DDVariableStore.DLL have been refactored in order to support both STAF V2.X and STAF V3.X</b>
<p>
STAFWrap.DLL, ComponentFunctions.DLL, DDVariableStore.DLL and associated scripts for registering DVariableStore.DLL
are included in the SAFS\bin directory.  The SetupSAFS script does register and\or move
files to system directories as necessary.
<p>
COM classes supporting COM access to STAF for use in VBScript and other COM-related
features exist in the latest version of DDVariableStore.DLL.  Consult the sourcecode in CVS
or any VBA or COM object browser until more proper documentation is made available.  A very
rudimentary "RUTHere" test script for this COM STAF interface can be found in
SAFS\bin\DDVariableStoreTest.VBS .

<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
If you have not done so, review the <a href="#reminders">Critical Reminders</a> above concerning
backups of locally modified or customized files from previous releases.<br>
I'd hate to say, "I told ya so."
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Short-N-Sweet install instructions:</b>
<p>
A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Windows Scripting Host V5.6 or later is required.  Refer
to <a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/SetupSAFS.README.htm" >SetupSAFS.README</a>
in the Java Runtime and Windows Scripting Host sections for more details and install
information for those tools.
<p><dd>
<ol>
<li><b>Extract the SAFSFramework ZIP file into ANY directory.</b><br/>
Extract all files of the ZIP file into ANY directory.&nbsp; A good choice might be something
like C:\TEMP, or even C:\SAFS.
<p>
<i>RRAFS (Rational Robot) users might do best to extract into
their ".\Program&nbsp;Files\Rational\Rational Test\sqabas32" directory. (Although this should not be
necessary with a RRAFS release since that includes the SAFS install files already. Only do
this if you are upgrading SAFS without upgrading RRAFS.)</i>
<p>
Enable "OVERWRITE Existing Files" if you are overwriting a previous release of SAFS.
<p>
<li><b>Run</b> the extracted &nbsp;<b>SetupSAFS_WIN64.BAT</b>&nbsp; script.</b><br/>
On 32-bit systems you can run SetupSAFS.wsf directly.<br/>
On 64-bit systems you <b>MUST</b> run SetupSAFS_WIN64.bat to use 32-bit processes.<br/>
In Windows Explorer, locate "SetupSAFS_WIN64.bat" in that directory and double-click to execute
it.
<p>
The installation will prompt to confirm the installation of the SAFS Framework and
the version of STAF to install, if any.&nbsp; The user has the option to skip these installations by pressing "No" or "Cancel" when prompted.
<p>
You do not need to reinstall STAF if you already have STAF installed. &nbsp;However, you can choose to reinstall STAF to overwrite STAF 2.X with the new STAF V3.X version.
<p>
<li><b>Setup SAFS and (optionally) Rational Functional Tester per
<a href="http://safsdev.sourceforge.net/sqabasic2000/SetupSAFS.README.htm">SetupSAFS.README</a></b><br/>
Verify/Complete any setup per that doc.
</ol>
</dl>
<p>
The installation will not install any program that will appear in Control Panel's
"Add/Remove Program" application.  However, depending upon the STAF install scenario, STAF might install <b>"Software Testing Automation Framework"</b> into the Control Panel's "Add/Remove Program" application.
