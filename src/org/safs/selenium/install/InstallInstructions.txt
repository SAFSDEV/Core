SeleniumPlus (Selenium+) is a Selenium WebDriver-enabled version of TestDesigner for Windows.
SeleniumPlus by default uses the FireFox browser.
If you do not have FireFox you can download and install it from: www.mozilla.org

According to users experiences, the chrome browser is faster and more stable, you
can download it from: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/

Selenium 2.52 is currently delivered with SeleniumPlus.
