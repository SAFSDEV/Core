# SAFS Core Project

This repository contains Core codes like: **services**, **drivers**, **engines** and **hooks** etc.

On top of the framework code, we also provide special **drivers** like: 
- SAFS
- JSAFS 
- SeleniumPlus 


for handling traditional *keywords test records* and Java API calls. 

The project contains **keyword implementation** *engines* for different testing tools 
like: [IBM Rational Functional Tester](http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Software/Rational/Rational_Functional_Tester/Overview), Selenium 1.0, [Selenium 2.0 WebDriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/), 
[iOS UIAutomation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/), [Android Robotium](https://github.com/robotiumtech/robotium) etc..

There are codes for *Image-Based Testing*, some rudimentary *Optical Character 
Recognition (OCR)*, *Cucumber integration*, and *Java AWT Robot enhancements*.

The **SAFS installation** code is also included in this repository.

This repository can be imported in Eclipse as a normal Java Project. It does have a dependency on another repository: [SAFS-Android-Remote-Control](https://github.com/SAFSDEV/SAFS-Android-Remote-Control).

To set up the development correctly, please refer to document [Environment Setup for Developers](https://github.com/kid551/Tmp-Test/blob/master/developer_setup.md).
